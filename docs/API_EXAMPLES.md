# ShopSmart API examples

Start the application with `npm run dev`, then send these requests through Bruno or another authorized API client.

## Health check

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Product list

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/products
```

## One product

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/products/1
```

## Create a simulated order

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerName": "Ana Reyes",
  "email": "ana@example.com",
  "address": "Angeles City, Pampanga",
  "items": [
    { "productId": 1, "quantity": 1 },
    { "productId": 2, "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

The server ignores prices from the browser and reads authoritative prices from PostgreSQL.

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/assistant/questions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "Which keyboard is below ₱2,000?"
}
```
